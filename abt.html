&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp         Two hotels of the Taj group, namely Rambagh Palace in Jaipur and the Taj Mahal Palace 
& Tower in Mumbai, were ranked in 2013 by Condé Nast Traveler among its "Top 100 Hotels and 
Resorts in the World".[12] In late 2013, the Indian Traveller magazine ranked Taj Lake Palace in
Udaipur and Taj Exotica Resort & Spa in Maldives as numbers 34 and 98, respectively, on its list 
of "100 Best Hotels & Resorts".[13] Condé Nast Traveler also ranked the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai
as number 13 on its list of "Gold Standard Hotels" in 2014.[14] In 2005, a famous luxury hotel in 
New York city, The Pierre was acquired.<br><br><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp          For a period of about 200 years from the mid-17th century, coaching inns served as a
place for lodging for coach travellers (in other words, a roadhouse). Coaching inns stabled teams 
of horses for stagecoaches and mail coaches and replaced tired teams with fresh teams. Traditionally
they were seven miles apart, but this depended very much on the terrain.<br><br><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp       Tremont House in Boston, United States, a luxury hotel, the first to provide indoor plumbing
Some English towns had as many as ten such inns and rivalry between them was intense, not only for
the income from the stagecoach operators but for the revenue for food and drink supplied to the 
wealthy passengers. By the end of the century, coaching inns were being run more professionally, 
with a regular timetable being followed and fixed menus for food.[3]<br><br><br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp       Inns began to cater for richer clients in the mid-18th century, and consequently grew in
grandeur and the level of service provided. One of the first hotels in a modern sense was opened 
in Exeter in 1768, although the idea only really caught on in the early 19th century. In 1812 
Mivart's Hotel opened its doors in London, later changing its name to Claridge's.[4]
Hotels proliferated throughout Western Europe and North America in the 19th century, and luxury 
hotels, including the Savoy Hotel in the United Kingdom and the Ritz chain of hotels in London 
and Paris and Tremont House and Astor House in the United States,[5] began to spring up in the 
later part of the century, catering to an extremely wealthy clientele.
